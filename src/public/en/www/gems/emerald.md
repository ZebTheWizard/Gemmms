Emerald is a pure activator of the heart chakra. It helps you stay centered in your heart's wisdom, and make choices from love and compassion. It opens your heart to receiving the flow of universal abundance available to us all, and in this way is an abundance stone.

Like chrysoprase, it can help you heal heartbreak and nourish your emotional self. Emerald is a stone of great harmony, wisdom and love. Giving your lover an Emerald will bring the lover closer if the giver's motives are pure love. The Emerald can be a bridge between two people. The Emerald vibrates with love.
