Jasper is a stone of grounding and stability, providing comfort and security, strength and healing. Its presence balances the aura to a level of wholeness and peace, and acts as a reminder that one is not here on the physical plane simply for oneself, but to bring joy and substance to others.

Jasper is a wonderful stone for healers and counselors to nurture themselves as they help others, and to be more empathetic to others' emotional and mental needs while still remaining objective in their work. Jasper is also a great stone for those who need a little help organizing their thoughts and staying focused.

Jasper is a wonderful grounding stone and can help pull one's scattered energies in to work where they are most needed. Keeping Jasper with you can aid in resolving difficult situations.
