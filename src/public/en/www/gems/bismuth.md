Bismuth is a crystalline, brittle metal that is silvery-white with an iridescent hue. As an elemental metal, its number is 83 on the Periodic Table. Bismuth is often lab-created which is why natural Bismuth is rare. It is a heavy, brittle metal that is primarily used in low-melt alloys. Since bismuth is a poor conductor of both heat and electricity, it is used as a replacement for lead.

Spiritually and metaphysically, Bismuth is used to help with visualization and shamanic journeying. It can prevent you from becoming overwhelmed by all of your responsibilities while at the same time increasing your energy levels to deal with them. Bismuth is a stone of transformation and change, helping to adapt to change with calm assurance. Bismuth encourages cohesiveness, so would be very helpful in group and/or relationship dynamics. Bismuth is also said to relieve feelings of loneliness or isolation.
