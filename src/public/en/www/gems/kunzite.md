Kunzite is a beautiful crystal, pure in energy and joyful in nature. In palest pink to light violet hues, it is a Stone of Emotion, opening and connecting the heart to the mind and stimulating a healing communion between the two.

Kunzite encourages one to release walls built around the heart for protection, and to be receptive to the experience of unconditional and abundant love.
