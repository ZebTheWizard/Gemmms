Citrine is a yellow Quartz, and is one of the most affordable gemstones. Its color ranges from pale yellow to brown due to ferric impurities. Natural Citrine is rare, and most Citrine on the market is produced by heating Amethyst and Smoky Quartz.

It takes on the healing properties of Quartz, and is great for balancing the Solar Plexus Chakra. Citrine is a joyful stone with bright energy which lights up many aspects of lives of those who work with it. It has energies of good fortune and good luck, though these may appear in unexpected ways.
