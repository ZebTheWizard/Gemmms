Many appreciate raw, uncut amethyst crystals for their untamed energy and ability to connect the user directly with the earth's natural power. These crystals often feature a stunning array of color and texture, with each one being a truly one-of-a-kind creation.

Tumbled amethyst stones, on the other hand, have been smoothed and polished, giving them a more refined and elegant appearance.

The connection between Amethyst and chakras

## Other crystals that work well with Amethyst
While Amethyst is a remarkably versatile and powerful crystal in its own right, it can also be enhanced and amplified when combined with other complementary stones. One of the most natural pairings for Amethyst is clear quartz, often called the "master healer" of the crystal kingdom. Combining Amethyst's calming and soothing energy with the amplifying properties of clear quartz can create a powerful synergy, enhancing the crystals' overall healing and spiritual effects.

Another crystal that works well with Amethyst is rose quartz, the stone of unconditional love.

Together, these two crystals can be powerful tools for healing emotional wounds and cultivating a deeper sense of self-compassion.^[How to Know If Your Heart Chakra is out of Balance - Natasha Nirvana. https://natashanirvana.com/2023/03/20/how-to-know-if-your-heart-chakra-is-out-of-balance/]

Citrine, the "success stone," is also a wonderful companion for Amethyst. While Amethyst is known for calming the mind and promoting inner peace, citrine is associated with creativity, optimism, and personal empowerment. By combining these two crystals, individuals can tap into a harmonious balance of spiritual and practical energy, allowing for greater manifestation and achievement of their goals.

Finally, black tourmaline, the "protector stone," can be an invaluable ally when working with Amethyst.
